# Routing in Express

This example illustrates how routing needs to be declared in Express

To run the example first install modules with npm

    npm install

Then start the server with

    node app.js

Then open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3000][1]

You will see a basic Express site. Then browse to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/about][2]. Along with 404 header you will see

    Cannot GET /about

The point of the example is that you need to set routes up in Express.
